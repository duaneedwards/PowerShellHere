# PowerShellHere
Chocolatey Package to setup an "Open PowerShell Here" right click menu item for Windows Explorer.

This will work on folder items, drives and even the background part of Windows Explorer.

If using Chocolatey, you can install by running in a command prompt:

```choco install powershellhere```

Similarly uninstallation can be done by running in a command prompt:

```choco uninstall powershellhere```

If you don't have Chocolatey you can just run the PowerShellHere.ps1 script to add the right click menu items to Windows Explorer.
