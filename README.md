# PowerShellHere
Chocolatey Package to setup "PowerShell Here" right click menu items for Windows Explorer

If using Chocolatey, you can install by running in a command prompt:

```choco install powershellhere```

Similarly uninstallation can be done by running in a command prompt:

```choco uninstall powershellhere```

If you don't have Chocolatey you can just run the PowerShellHere.ps1 script to add the right click menu items to Windows Explorer.
